# Donation

ParsBench is a self-found project for my weekends. I developed it far here using volunteer help of companies and individuals. If you want to donate me, here are some ways.

## Support Me

You can support me by donating any amount of money you want. I will spend it on paying APIs and GPUs :)

## Buy Me a Coffee

Buy coffee for my internal engine. It's a fuel to my brain for higher speed of coding.
